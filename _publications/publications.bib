  abstract  = {Computer graphics can not only generate synthetic images and ground truth but it also offers the possibility of constructing virtual worlds in which: (i) an agent can perceive, navigate, and take actions guided by AI algorithms, (ii) properties of the worlds can be modified (e.g., material and reflectance), (iii) physical simulations can be performed, and (iv) algorithms can be learnt and evaluated. But creating realistic virtual worlds is not easy. The game industry, however, has spent a lot of effort creating 3D worlds, which a player can interact with. So researchers can build on these resources to create virtual worlds, provided we can access and modify the internal data structures of the games. To enable this we created an open-source plugin UnrealCV (Project website: http://unrealcv.github.io) for a popular game engine Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). We show two applications: (i) a proof of concept image dataset, and (ii) linking Caffe with the virtual world to test deep network algorithms.},

These advanced features are often accessible through visual scripting interfaces used in rapid prototyping and by non-programmers. The goal of this research was to demonstrate that these tools can support implementation of artificial intelligence techniques, such as reinforcement learning, that have the potential to yield dynamic characters that are not pre-programmed, but rather learn their behavior via algorithms. Its novelties are the implementation of a Q-Learning bot, created in Unreal Engine's visual scripting tool, known as Blueprint.},

  abstract  = {Developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles in real world is an expensive and time consuming process. Also, in order to utilize recent advances in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground upÂ to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.},

In this study, a virtual reality software system was built with the intention to create a safe environment, where the performance of wheelchair control interfaces could be tested and compared. We use this to evaluate our eye tracking input methodology, a promising solution for hands-free wheelchair navigation, because of the abundance of control commands that it offers and its intuitive nature. Natural eye movements have long been considered to reflect cognitive processes and are highly correlated with user intentions. Therefore, the sequence of gaze locations during navigation is recorded and analyzed, in order to search and unveil patterns in saccadic movements. Moreover, this study compares different eye-based solutions that have previously been implemented, and proposes a new, more natural approach. The preliminary results on N = 6 healthy subjects indicate that the proposed free-view solution leads to 18.4% faster completion of the task (440 sec) benchmarked against a naive free-view approach.},

With this increasing popularity and ubiquitous deployment, resilience has become a critical requirement for public acceptance and adoption.

Prior work in this area has studied the safety and resilience of individual components of the AV system (e.g., testing of neural networks powering the perception function). However, methods for holistic end-to-end resilience assessment of AV systems are still non-existent.},

  abstract  = {Active-shooter incidents within a school setting involve a unique subset of active-shooter events. These events tend to have significant differences in duration and outcome to events that occur in other locations, often being resolved before, or when, first-responders arrive on the scene. The frequency and seriousness of these events inspired the US Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate's First Responder's Group (DHS S{\&}T FRG) to leverage ongoing work with the US Army Research Laboratory, Human Research and Engineering Directorate, Advanced Training {\&} Simulation Division (ARL HRED ATSD) to establish a prototype virtual school environment to prepare teachers, administrators and staff on how to respond and work with Law Enforcement (LE) in the event of a school shooting. This virtual platform allows school staff and LE to practice various strategies and even supports analysis into how different security measures within the school environment might change the dynamic of an attack and response. The goal is to train affected groups together in advance of an attack to improve coordination and reduce response time and casualties. This paper illustrates design choices for training school teachers, administrators and other staff in a virtual environment in the event of a school shooting. These choices demonstrate unique development strategies related to controlling Artificial Intelligence (AI) through simple user interfaces, managing crowd behaviors and ultimately will include the ability to apply game engine level rules to different buildings or maps.},

It is based on calculating coordination point and find the straight path to goal. The other function is collision avoidance function. It is implemented by deep Q-network model. Both two function will output rotating degree, agent will combine both output and turn direct. Besides, deep Q-network can also make quadcopter fly up and down to bypass the obstacle and arrive at goal. Our experimental result shows that collision rate is 14% after 500 flights. Based on this work, we will train more complex sense and transfer model to real quadcopter.},

For surgeons using robotic surgical platforms, maintaining spatial awareness of the anatomical structures in the surgical area is key for good outcomes. We propose a Mixed Reality system which allows surgeons to visualize and interact with aligned anatomical models extracted from preoperative imagery as well as the in vivo imagery from the stereo laparoscope. To develop this system, we have employed techniques to 3D reconstruct stereo laparoscope images, model 3D shape of the anatomical structures from preoperative MRI stack and align the two 3D surfaces. The application we have developed allows surgeons to visualize occluded and obscured organ boundaries as well as other important anatomy that is not visible through the laparoscope alone, facilitating better spatial awareness during surgery. The system was deployed in 9 robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy procedures as part of a feasibility study.},

  abstract = {In this correspondence paper, we develop a teleoperated robotic 3-D mapping (TeRoM) system which enables efficient human-guided mapping of remote environments for realistic rendering and visualization. First, the hardware design of the TeRoM system is proposed which is based on a Pioneer mobile robot platform and a rotating RGB-D camera. A client/server architecture is developed to allow the data to be processed in a remote server, which makes it possible to implement 3-D mapping on robots with limited resources. Second, a 3-D map is created in real-time while an operator controls the robot and the pan-tilt unit remotely using a joystick. Then the map is converted into a mesh using the marching cubes algorithm and optimized to reduce the data volume. Finally the mesh is imported and rendered in a 3-D rendering engine for interactive and intuitive display. We evaluate the performance of the TeRoM system in terms of accuracy, processing speed, reliability, and manipulability.},

  abstract = {Abstract The traditional practice teaching mode of Weft-knitting Engineering leads to unsatisfactory teaching outcomes due to the lack of hardware in laboratory and security issue in knitting mill. This paper presents a 3D virtual Weft-knitting Engineering learning system based on Unreal Engine 4. The technological design of weft-knitted fabrics including automatic design of jacquard pattern and the transformation of jacquard pattern, knitting notation, needle set-out, and cams arrangement is realized through the establishment of mathematical model and algorithm in Unreal Engine 4. Corresponding cam configuration operation from the first person perspective is implemented in virtual practice operation part. The system provides learners a holistic cognition of weft-knitting practice from machine structure, design of the weft-knitted fabrics, virtual practice operation on the machine to 3D interactive Virtual Weft-knitted fabrics. The experiment result shows that the virtual learning system developed in this study can improve the teaching effect of Weft-knitting Engineering especially in operational skills, and the combination of traditional plus virtual learning system method is the better way to optimize the teaching effect. The learnersâ feedback indicates that 3D virtual Weft-knitting Engineering learning system is more convenient and immersive in which they feel like using real machine in real knitting mill. With the software combination of Unreal Engine 4 and Houdini, the bottom frame of the program offers great expansibility for more complex machine model and operation to the system in future. The design framework and discussions in this paper may be useful for developing virtual learning system in other areas.},

  abstract  = {Robotic vision, unlike computer vision, typically involves processing a stream of images from a camera with time varying pose operating in an environment with time varying lighting conditions and moving objects. Repeating robotic vision experiments under identical conditions is often impossible, making it difficult to compare different algorithms. For machine learning applications a critical bottleneck is the limited amount of real world image data that can be captured and labelled for both training and testing purposes. In this paper we investigate the use of a photo-realistic simulation tool to address these challenges, in three specific domains: robust place recognition, visual SLAM and object recognition. For the first two problems we generate images from a complex 3D environment with systematically varying camera paths, camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. For the first time we are able to systematically characterise the performance of these algorithms as paths and lighting conditions change. In particular, we are able to systematically generate varying camera viewpoint datasets that would be difficult or impossible to generate in the real world. We also compare algorithm results for a camera in a real environment and a simulated camera in a simulation model of that real environment. Finally, for the object recognition domain, we generate labelled image data and characterise the viewpoint dependency of a current convolution neural network in performing object recognition. Together these results provide a multi-domain demonstration of the beneficial properties of using simulation to characterise and analyse a wide range of robotic vision algorithms.},

This BCI-VR system prototype was functionally tested on multiple participants and demonstrated live before an audience during the 2017 `Hack the Brain' at the Dublin Science Gallery. The availability of such an open-source, effective, BCI-VR Game Control Development Environment, at a level acceptable for industry experimentation, has the potential to open up this field to a much wider range of researchers and games developers and to assist the investigation of gaming experiences which both incorporate the specific control features available through BCI as a core element of the game play and the potential for its use in neurorehabilitation.},
